 •	How do I approach designing software?
o	I approach the design of the software by first understanding what the goal was, how I can get there, and what kind o problem could I face on my way. Then I divide the work into small tasks to minimize error and maximize my time efficiency.

•	What new design skills have your work on the project helped you to craft?
o	The improvement and development of new skills definitely impacted my process to develop assignments and projects, skills like solving problems and time management were crucial since I have a limited amount of time so I had to take advantage of every second. Solving problems skill was crucial for the development of this assignment since the creation of objects and manipulation of light and texture is a little complicated.

•	What design process did you follow for your project work?
o	I divide it into small parts to minimize errors and once I was confident with the part, I will test it in case do not run as properly. 

•	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
o	I learned a lot from this class, but one of the most important things is that my level of solving problems increase since it was a challenge to develop and create figures, and that was something that I never did before. Also, learning fast helped me to develop my projects more quickly.

•	How do I approach developing programs?
o	I develop the program by first reading the requirements and understanding what I need to do. I like to do a little research to have as much information as possible to be able to be more efficient in my development. Then I divide it into small tasks for better development.

•	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
o	I usually tend to have the same development strategy it's been useful when developing a new project. But in this case, since the class was more challenging than my other classes, I decided to watch a video from YouTube relative to my project plus the videos provided by the instructor. This helped me to improve my work.

•	How did iteration factor into your development?
o	The interaction was important in the project, I follow an iterative approach of creating objects, adding features, texture, and light. This helped me to make it easier to develop objects to make a small change but create more efficient stuff.

•	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
o	My approach has become more efficient and modularized through this process. Now, I look for different ways to approach the problem and spend less time solving minor problems which are not as important and will not affect my code.
•	How can computer science help me in reaching my goal?
o	Computer science help to learn more about technology and how is developed internally by coding it and its function. I have a better idea of the innovation of the future and their design
•	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
o	Computational graphics and visualization will help me in my future visualization projects. The new knowledge acquired will be useful when trying to develop projects like video games and 3D scenarios, but also provide me the ability to perfectionated my code development. Also, computational graphics and visualization help me understand how computational of the CPU and GPU are used in the process of graphics.
•	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
o	Even though I’m seeking a different path to computational graphics and visualization, I found it helpful to help me to develop and understand programming and development. I see myself more confident with all the knowledge of C++ language.
