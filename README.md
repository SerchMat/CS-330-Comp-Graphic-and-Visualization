* How do I approach designing software?
      - I approach the design of the software by first understanding what was the goal, how I am able to get there, and what kind o problem could I face on my way. Then I divide the work into small tasks to minimize error and maximize my time efficiency. 
  
* What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      The improvement and development of new skills definitely impacted my process to develop assignments and projects, skills like solving problems and time management were crucial since I have a limited amount of time so I had to take advantage of every second. Solving problems skill was crucial for the development of this assignment since the creation of objects and manipulation of light and texture is a little complicated. 
      
* What design process did you follow for your project work?
      I divide it into small parts to minimize errors and once I was confident with the part done I will test it in case do not run as properly. 
      
    *How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      I learned a lot from this class, but one of the most important things is that my level of solving problems increase since it was a challenge to develop and create figures, and that was something that I never did before. Also, learning fast helped me to develop my projects more quickly.

     *How do I approach developing programs?
       I develop the program by first reading the reqirements and undertanding what I need to do. I like to do a little of reserach to have as much information as possible to be able to be more efficient on my development. Then I divide it into small task for a better development.
      
     *What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
       I usually tend to have the same development startegy it's been usuful when develop a new project. But in this case, since the class was a more challenging than my other classes, I decided to watch video from YouTube relative to my project plus the videos provided by the instructor. This defenetely helped me to improve my work.
       
     *How did iteration factor into your development?
       
     *How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
