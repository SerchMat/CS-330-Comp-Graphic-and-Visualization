How do I approach designing software?
  I approach the design of the software by first undertanding the what was the goal, how I am able to get there and what kind o problem could I face on my way. Then I divide the work into small task to minimize error and maximize my time efficiency. 
  
    *What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      The improve and develop of new skill defetely impacted on my process to develop assigments and project, skill like solving problems and tieme managment were crucial since I have a limited amount of time so I had to take advantage of every second. Solving prblem skill was crucial for the develop of this assigment since the creation of object and manipulation of light and texture is a little complicated. 
      
    *What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I divide into small part to minimize errors and once I was confident with the part done I will tested in case do not run as properly. 
      
    *How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
